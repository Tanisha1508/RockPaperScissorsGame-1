# RPSGame
A Deep Learning Game with Flask Framework
Developed a flask web application to play rock paper scissors with a bot. The concept of convolutional nueral networks has been used to train a set of 800 images. A hand detection module has been created to detect hands in any image. The player plays the game with a bot using live web camera and the model detects the hand and predicts whether it is a rock, paper or scissors and the score is updated.

The app can be accessed at https://rock-paper-scissors-playgame.herokuapp.com/
